# Contributing

This project is currently fast-moving and experimental.

## Dev setup
- Python 3.10+ recommended
- Create/activate a venv
- Install deps (when requirements exist)

## Style
- Keep scripts small and composable
- Prefer explicit CLI flags over hidden globals
- Write logs to `logs/` (avoid noisy stdout in library code)

## Pull requests
- Describe what you changed and why
- Include reproduction commands and expected output
